So sweet
I give you kisses in the backseat
I whisper secrets in the backbeat
You make me cry, you make me happy, happy (happy)
Leave my lipstick on the cigarette
Just toss it, and you stomp it out, out
Inhalin' whiskey when you kiss my neck
We've been hurtin', but it's happy hour, oh, hour
Oh, oh, oh
